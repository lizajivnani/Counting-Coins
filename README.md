# Counting-Coins

This project implements a coin detection and classification using a combination of image segmentation and edge detection techniques. The primary goal is to accurately identify and categorize U.S. coins, specifically pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters, from raw image inputs.

Input and Output
Input: Raw images containing U.S. coins. <br>
Output: A text file formatted as follows: <br>
<n: Total_number_of_coins_detected> <br>
Followed by n lines, each detailing the detected coins in the format: <br>
<x, y, coin_value> <br>


This project is ideal for applications in automated coin counting systems, vending machines, and educational tools aimed at teaching coin recognition.
